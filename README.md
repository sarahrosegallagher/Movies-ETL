# Movies ETL

## Tools
* SQLAlchemy
* PostgreSQL
* Pandas
    * Cleaning and exploration including regular expressions, mapping, try/except, for loops, and lambda functions

## Summary
This analysis involved extensive cleaning and transforming of three datasets to load into pgAdmin/postgreSQL for use by others in a machine learning hackathon. This included merging two movie datasets by handling varying column titles and data types as well as handling a ratings dataset with 26 million entries. I then refactored the ETL process into an automated pipeline to take in new data, perform the transformations, and load the data into existing tables.
